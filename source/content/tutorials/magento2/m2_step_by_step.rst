Step by Step guide to making your Magento 2 Website Fly
=======================================================

Magento2 is a PHP-based e-commerce platform.
They have two editions:

- Community Edition (CE)

- Enterprise Edition (EE)

Whichever the case, Ofcourse you want to get started with increasing the performance
of your website!
So Lets get Started!

1. Installing Magento from the `Magento-Site`_
----------------------------------------------

2. :doc:`Installing Varnish </content/tutorials/varnish/varnish_ubuntu>`
------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. How to place Magento 2 behind Varnish
-----------------------------------------

Here we discuss how to configure your Magento2 behind Varnish.

The Magento2 Admin states that built-in Application cache is not recommended for production use, but that doesnot mean that varnish is configured. Varnish needs to be installed and the configuration file suitably configured and deployed.

We assume that you have Magento2 installed and running on your backend servers and that your server is a Debian based Linux Server.

Configuring Magento
...................

1. Visit the Magento 2 Admin page and go to:

 	-> Stores

	-> Advanced

	-> System

	-> Full Page Cache

Here switch caching application to **Varnish**

This is what the Magento 2 Admin page should look like

2. Configuring for Varnish

- Under the Additional section, find a button for exporting the ready-made configuration file for varnish 3 or 4. We recommned you used varnish 4.0 now.

Therefore click on::
	-> Export VCL for Varnish 4
	this is usually named varnish.vcl

Place the file in a varnish folder for configuration (any safe place for you).

- Next to add varnish repository follow the instructions over at :ref:`Install Varnish <varnish_ubuntu>`

3.  Testing your set up

Now to check if your services are up and running::

``$ ps -e | grep 'apache2|varnish'``

If you recieve outputs like the ones below::

 1143 ?        00:00:03 varnishd
 1148 ?        00:00:17 varnishd
 1366 ?        00:02:02 varnishlog
 1591 ?        00:00:01 apache2
 11743 ?       00:00:10 apache2
 11744 ?       00:00:10 apache2

Congratulations! You have your services running on the backend.

Now we need to check the Magento2 frontend::
As you may have already noticed above, there is a ``varnishlog`` process running as well.


If you are interested in trying out an installation try downloading Marko's
Vagrant Box `marko_magento2github`_.
His installation used niginx with varnish and magento.You can also read more
about that at Marko's blogpost about Placing Magento2 behind Varnish `marko_magento2post`_.

4. Restart services after making changes
-----------------------------------------

.. literalinclude:: /content/examples/snippet2_restart_systemd
  :language: VCL

5. Basic Caching
----------------

Varnish doesnot cache cookies or its headers. But some cookies are marked as safe
by the magento site. Therefore it is recommended to remove or ignore these cookies
so that varnish can cache anything.

An example like the following will help to unset/remove unwanted cookies.

Update your `default.vcl` with this code or a similar code of your choice.

Under the `vcl_recv` add the following code.

warning: Make sure to add the code below the default code given for `vcl_recv`

.. literalinclude:: /content/examples/snippet3_remove_cookies
  :language: VCL

6. Excluding certain URLs
-------------------------

Not all URLs should be cached. Especially not in sites that deal with personal
information such as credit card information.

.. literalinclude:: /content/examples/m2_exclude_url.vcl
  :language: VCL

7. Extended Caching
-------------------

There is a subroutine called *vcl_fetch* which is by default set to 120 seconds
as can be seen. You can extend this caching value by

.. literalinclude:: /content/examples/vcl_fetch.vcl
  :language: VCL

This sets the ttl to 5 seconds, thus varnish picks up changes every 5sec.
Add this subroutine right below the *backend default*.

However, there is a downside to short TTL values that is they increase the load
not only in the backend servers but also the front end servers. Of course this
gives you a better control over your cache, but it also increases overheads such
as network traffic, response times becomes slower thus diminishing the whole
purpose of varnish.

So decreasing TTL values is not a good solution for high traffic based servers.
Varnish has a better solution for that.

8. Specific TTL Based Caching
-----------------------------

Varnish creates a TTL value for every object in the cache. A most effective way
of increasing a websites hit ratio is to increase the time-to-live (ttl) of the
objects.


Visit the Magento Docs
----------------------

You can always refer to the `Configure and Use Varnish <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/config~guide/varnish/config~varnish.html>`_
at the Magento site.

To see the guide on installing and configuring Magento with Varnish on webserver,
please look at `here <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/config~guide/varnish/config~varnish~configure.html>`_.
